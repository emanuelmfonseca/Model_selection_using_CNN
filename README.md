# Phylogeography model selection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the scripts used to generate simulated datasets and compare them using convolutional neural network (CNN) from Fonseca et al. (Fonseca EM, Colli GR, Werneck FP, Carstens BC. Phylogeographic model selection using convolutional neural networks. In review).

Note that after each simulation procedure the script entitled "Creating_cnn_folder" should be used to construct the input folder for CNN analysis.  

Before submitting them here, scripts were tested on mac (Mac mini, 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 2 cores).
